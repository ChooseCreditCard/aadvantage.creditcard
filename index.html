  <!-- Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>What Is an Airline Mileage Credit Card?</h2>
    <p>A mileage credit card links directly to an airline loyalty program. Instead of earning cashback or flexible points, every purchase contributes to your balance of airline miles — which can then be redeemed for flights, upgrades, or partner routes across the global network.</p>
    <p>These cards are generally best for people who travel consistently enough to leverage award seats, especially long-haul or premium-cabin redemptions where miles can yield outsized value.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Earning -->
  <section id="earning" class="section">
    <h2>How Spending Converts Into Loyalty Miles</h2>
    <p>Most airline cards award a base earn rate on everyday spending, with higher multipliers for categories like airfare, hotels or dining. Some mileage programs also reward members with bonus miles or status credits for purchasing flights directly through the airline.</p>
    <p>For frequent travelers, combining card spend with actual flights is often the fastest route to elite-tier benefits like lounge access, priority services and free checked bags.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Redeeming -->
  <section id="redeem" class="section">
    <h2>How Airline Miles Are Redeemed</h2>
    <p>Mileage redemptions depend on route pricing, availability, aircraft type and whether you’re booking during peak travel periods. Premium cabins and long-haul itineraries often offer the best return on miles, while economy awards during holidays can offer lower relative value.</p>
    <p>Many carriers impose carrier-imposed surcharges on certain award flights, so it’s important to check total fees before redeeming.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Extra section -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Partner Airlines & Alliance Benefits</h2>
    <p>Airline loyalty programs often include multiple partner carriers. This means miles earned with one airline can often be used to book flights on others, widening your award availability and making premium routes easier to secure.</p>
    <p>However, partner award charts can differ significantly from the primary airline’s pricing. Always compare the total mileage required before committing.</p>
